# Strings

## Exercises:

Using **Visual Studio Code**, complete the following programs.

## 03-0: Slices
Create a file called **slices.py**.  Write a program with the following specifications:

### Input
* A string
### Output
* In the first line, print the third character of this string.
* In the second line, print the second to last character of this string.
* In the third line, print the first five characters of this string.
* In the fourth line, print all but the last two characters of this string.
* In the fifth line, print all the characters of this string with even indices (remember indexing starts at 0, so the characters are displayed starting with the first).
* In the sixth line, print all the characters of this string with odd indices (i.e. starting with the second character in the string).
* In the seventh line, print all the characters of the string in reverse order.
* In the eighth line, print every second character of the string in reverse order, starting from the last one.
* In the ninth line, print the length of the given string.

## 03-1: Number of Words
Create a file called **numberOfWords.py**.  Write a program with the following specifications:

### Input

* A string consisting of words separated by spaces

### Output

* The number of words the given string has. **Note:**  To solve the problem, use the method **count**.

## 03-2: Two Halves
Create a file called **twoHalves.py**.  Write a program with the following specifications:

### Input

* A string

### Output
* Cut it into two "equal" parts ***(If the length of the string is odd, place the center character in the first string, so that the first string contains one more characther than the second)***. Now print a new string on a single row with the first and second halfs interchanged ***(second half first and the first half second)***.  Don't use the statement **if** in this task.

## 03-3: Replace 1
