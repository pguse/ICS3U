# Making Decisions

## Exercises:
Using **Visual Studio Code**, complete the following programs.

## 01-0: Is it Odd?
Create a file called **isOdd.py**.  Create a program with the following specifications: **Input:**  An integer, **Output:** print "YES" if it's odd and print "NO" otherwise.

## 01-1: At Least One Odd Number?
Create a file called **atLeastOneOdd.py**.  Create a program with following specifications:  **Input:**  two integers, **Output:**  print "YES" if at least one of them is odd and print "NO" otherwise.

## 01-2: Ascending Integers?
Create a file called **ascending.py**.  Create a program with the following specifications:  **Input:** three different integers, **Output:** print YES if they're given in ascending order, print NO otherwise.

## 01-3: How Many Days in a Month?
Create a file called **daysInMonth.py**.  Create a program with the following specifications:  **Input:**  A month - an integer from 1 (January) to 12 (December), **Output:**  print the number of days in it in the year 2017 (or any other non-leap year).

## 01-4: Solve for x
Create a file called **linearEquation.py**.  Create a program that solves a linear equation ax = b, in integers, with the following specifications:  **Input:**  two integers a and b (a may be zero), **Output:**  print a single integer root (solution) if it exists and print "no solution" or "many solutions" otherwise.

## 01-5: Rook Move

Create a file called **rookMove.py**. Chess rook moves horizontally or vertically. Given two different cells of the chessboard, determine whether a rook can go from the first cell to the second in one move.  The program receives the **input** of four numbers from 1 to 8, each specifying the column and row number, first two - for the first cell, and then the last two - for the second cell. The program should output YES if a rook can go from the first cell to the second in one move, or NO otherwise.
