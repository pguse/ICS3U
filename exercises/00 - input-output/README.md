# Input-Output

## Exercises:

Using **Visual Studio Code**, create separate programs to solve the following problems.

## 00-0: Perimeter
Create a file called **perimeter.py**.  The user should enter the **length** and **width** of a rectangle, and the program should output the rectangle's **perimeter**.

## 00-1: Area of a Circle
Create a file called **circleArea.py**.  The user should enter the **radius** of a circle, and the program should output the circle's **area**.  **Note:**  Use the **math** module for the value of PI - it is described in **Lesson 2** on **Snakify**.

## 00-2: Swap Digits
Create a file called **swap.py**.  The user should enter a **two-digit** number (example: 17), and the program should output the **number** with **swapped digits** (example: 71).

## 00-3: Day of the Week
Create a file called **dayWeek.py**.  Let's count the days of the week as follows: 0 - Sunday, 1 - Monday, 2 - Tuesday, ..., 6 - Saturday. **Given** an integer **K** in the range 1 to 365, **output** the **number** of the **day of the week** for the K-th day of the year provided that this year's January 1 is Monday ***(which it is for 2018)*** .  Think about how you will determine (test) if your program is working.  As a comment in your program, describe what you did to test that your program functions correctly.

## 00-4: Snail
Create a program called **snail.py**.  A snail goes **up A centimetres** during the day and **falls B centimetres** at night. How long does it take him to go up **H centimetres**? **Given** three integer numbers **H, A and B** (A > B), the program should **output** a **number of days**.  Think about how you will determine (test) if your program is working.  As a comment in your program, describe what you did to test that your program functions correctly.
