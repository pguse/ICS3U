# Input-Output

## Exercises:

Using **Visual Studio Code**, create separate programs to solve the following problems.

## 00-0: Perimeter
Create a file called **perimeter.py**.  The user should enter the **length** and **width** of a rectangle, and the program should output the rectangle's **perimeter**.  Here is an example of how the program should run:

```
Length:  4
Width:  3
Perimeter: 14
```

## 00-1: Area of a Circle
Create a file called **circleArea.py**.  The user should enter the **radius** of a circle, and the program should output the circle's **area**.  **Note:**  Use the **math** module for the value of PI - it is described in **Lesson 2** on **Snakify**.  Here is an example of how the program should run:

```
Radius:  5
Area:  78.53981633974483
```

## 00-2: Hypotenuse of a Right-Angled Triangle
Create a file called **hypotenuse.py**.  The user should enter the base and height of a right angled-triangle, and the program should output the length of the triangle's hypotenuse.  **Note:** Use the **math** module calculuating the square root.  Here is a [link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) to its documentation page.

Here is an example of how the program should run:

```
Base:  3
Height:  4
Hypotenuse: 5.0
```

## 00-3: Swap Digits *(using the modulus % operator)*
Create a file called **swap.py**.  The user should enter a **two-digit** number (example: 17), and the program should output the **number** with **swapped digits** (example: 71).  Here is an example of how the program should run:

```
Number:  17
Swapped Digits:  71
```

## 00-4: Day of the Week *(using the modulus % operator)*
Create a file called **dayWeek.py**.  Let's count the days of the week as follows: 0 - Sunday, 1 - Monday, 2 - Tuesday, ..., 6 - Saturday. **Given** an integer **K** in the range 1 to 365, **output** the **number** of the **day of the week** for the K-th day of the year provided that this year's January 1 is Tuesday ***(which it is for 2019)*** .  Think about how you will determine (test) if your program is working.  As a comment in your program, describe what you did to test that your program functions correctly.  Here are some examples of how the program should run:

```
Number:  1
Day of the Week:  2
```

```
Number:  145
Day of the Week:  6
```
