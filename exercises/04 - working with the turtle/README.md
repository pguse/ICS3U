# Working with the Turtle

## Exercises

Using **Visual Studio Code**, create a file called **turtleIntro.py** and complete the following challenges.

## 04-1:  Polygon
Create a function called polygon(s,n) that will draw any polygon with n sides, where the side length is s.

So,

polygon(50,5)

should draw a ***pentagon*** with side lengths of 50 pixels.

**Note:**  To figure out how this function works, create two other functions:  **triangle(s)** and **pentagon(s)**, that will draw a triangle and pentagon with side lengths **s**.  Use what you learn by creating these functions to create the **polygon(s,n)** function.

## 04-2:  Row

(i) Use your **square(s)** function to define a function (using the keyword def) called **row(s, n)** that draws a row of n squares of side length s.  (ii) Use your **row(s, n)** function to draw a row of 3 squares of side length 50.

## 04-3:  Grid 

(i) Use your **row(s, n)** function to define a function called **grid(s, n)** that draws a grid of n x n squares of side length s.  (ii) Use your **grid(s, n)** function to draw a 3 x 3 grid of squares of side length 50..

## 04-4:  Stairs

(i) Use your **row(s, n)** function to define a function called **stairs(s, n)** that draws a set of stairs made of squares of side length s with a base n squares wide.  (ii) Use your **stairs(s, n)** function to draw a set of stairs made of squares of side length 50 with a base 4 squares wide.
