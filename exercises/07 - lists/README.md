Lists are a data structure that allow you to store multiple values using one assigned name.  Read this [note](https://github.com/pguse/ics3u/tree/master/notes/08%20-%20Lists) for an introduction to lists.

## Exercises:

Using **Visual Studio Code**, create a file called ***functionsExercises.py*** .  Within this file,

* create all the functions described below
* use each function to perform a **calculation** and **output** the result

## 07-0: Even Elements
Write a function called ***circleArea(radius)*** that calculates and outputs the area of a circle, given its **radius**.

## 07-1: Greater than Previous
Write a function called ***hypotenuse(a,b)*** that calculates and returns the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides **a** and **b**.

## 07-2: Neighbours of the Same Sign
Write a function called ***slope(x1,y1,x2,y2)*** that calculates and returns the slope of a line passing through the points **(x1,y1)** and **(x2,y2)**.

## 07-3: The Number of Distinct Elements
Write a function called ***distance(x1,y1,x2,y2)*** that calculates and returns the distance between the points **(x1,y1)** and **(x2,y2)**.

## 07-4: Swap Neighbours
Write a function called ***reverse(text)*** , that takes in a string called **text** and returns the characters in reverse order. This is a simple way to encode a message.
