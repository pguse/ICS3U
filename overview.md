### COURSE DESCRIPTION: 

This course introduces students to computer science. Students will design software independently and as part of a team, using industry-standard programming tools and applying the software development life-cycle model. They will also write and use subprograms within computer programs. Students will develop creative solutions for various types of problems as their understanding of the computing environment grows.  They will also explore environmental and ergonomic issues, emerging research in computer science, and global career trends in computer-related fields.

### TOPICS OF STUDY:

Unit | Learning Goals | Time
| :-------------: |-------------| :-----:|
|Programming Concepts and Skills | demonstrate the ability to use different data types, including one-dimensional arrays, in computer programs; demonstrate the ability to use control structures and simple algorithms in computer programs; demonstrate the ability to use subprograms within computer programs; use proper code maintenance techniques and conventions when creating computer programs. | 30 h |
|Software Development – Part 1 | use a variety of problem-solving strategies to solve different types of problems independently and as part of a team | 25 h |
| Software Development – Part 2 | design software solutions to meet a variety of challenges; design algorithms according to specifications; apply a software development life-cycle model to a software development project.	| 25 h |
| Computer Environments and Systems | relate the specifications of computer components to user requirements; use appropriate file maintenance practices to organize and safeguard data; demonstrate an understanding of the software development process.	| 10 h |
|Topics in Computer Science | describe policies on computer use that promote environmental stewardship and sustainability; demonstrate an understanding of emerging areas of computer science research; describe postsecondary education and career prospects related to computer studies.	| 15 h |
|Final Assessment Tasks	| | 5 h |

### LEARNING SKILLS & WORK HABITS:

The development of learning skills and work habits is an integral part of a student’s learning.  Your learning skills (Responsibility, Organization, Independent Work, Collaboration, Initiative and Self-Regulation) will be based on assessment and observation of your daily in class activities and work done outside of the classroom.  The learning skills will be evaluated using a four-point scale (E * excellent, G * good, S * satisfactory, U * unsatisfactory) and will be used to determine your Learning Strategies Level as described in section 6.4 of the student handbook.

### COURSE EXPECTATIONS:

*	Show respect for yourself and others at all times.  This includes raising your hand when you have something to say.  Do not speak out of turn and please listen respectfully.
*	Obtain notes and homework for any missed classes.
*	Arrive for class on time with all the necessary supplies and work until the end of class.
*	Keep your notebook in order (work should be dated and homework should be clearly identified by section, page number and/or assigned questions).
*	Complete homework as it is assigned.
*	Seek help in and out of class as needed.

### MARKS:	

*	Your final mark is based on the following breakdown:

#### 70%	Term Work

| Category	| % Overall Mark | Success Criteria	| Strategies/Methods for Assessment and Evaluation |

### ASSESSMENT POLICY:	

*	You are responsible for reading section 6.6.2 of the student handbook which includes our policies on academic honesty and late and missed assignments.

### EXTRA HELP:
*	Your first opportunity for extra help is during the academic day during the advisor meetings on Mondays and Wednesdays. You may also make an appointment to meet during a Resource Centre Study Period or after school.  Plan ahead and use your time wisely.
